# Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN and ANN

This project uses deep learning models (CNN and ANN) to classify human facial emotions such as **happy, sad, angry, fear, disgust, neutral, and surprise**.

## 🧩 Features
- Two models: **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** and **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- Built with **PyTorch**
- Trained on a labeled dataset of facial expressions
- GPU support for faster training
- Visual performance reports and confusion matrices

## 📈 Results
| Model | Accuracy | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| ANN    | ~85% | Generalized well |
| CNN    | ~90%+ | Learned detailed spatial features |
